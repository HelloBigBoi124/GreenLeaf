# 🌱 GreenLeaf - CO₂ Calculator App  

**GreenLeaf** is an Android application designed to raise awareness about environmental preservation by calculating the estimated amount of CO₂ removed from the atmosphere based on tree planting.  

## 📌 Why We Developed This App  

Deforestation and wildfires in biomes like the **Brazilian Cerrado** release enormous amounts of CO₂, worsening climate change. We created **GreenLeaf** to:  
✅ **Show the positive impact** of tree planting in reducing atmospheric CO₂.  
✅ **Encourage reforestation** by making the benefits measurable.  
✅ **Promote environmental awareness** in a simple and interactive way.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  

- Developed with **MIT App Inventor** (a visual programming tool for Android apps).  
- Simple and intuitive interface for easy use.  

## 📱 How It Works  

1. **User Input:**  
   - Upon opening the app, the user is prompted to enter **the number of trees planted** (as a whole number).  

2. **Automatic Calculation:**  
   - The app calculates **how much CO₂ can be removed** from the atmosphere based on scientific estimates (each tree absorbs ~22 kg of CO₂ per year on average).  

3. **Result Display:**  
   - The app shows the **total CO₂ reduction** in kilograms (kg).  

## 🔹 Key Features  

✔ **Simple & Fast** – Just input the number of trees and get an instant result.  
✔ **Educational** – Helps users understand the environmental impact of tree planting.  
✔ **Lightweight** – Small APK size, compatible with most Android devices.
